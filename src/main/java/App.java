     * Prompt #1: Design a simple Service.Library system
     *
     * Create a set of classes in Java to represent a basic library system. It should allow:
     * 1) Adding a book to the library.
     * 2) Checking out a book to a user.
     * 3) Returning a book.
     *
     * Keep it simple for now: assume the library only has one copy of each book, and users can check out multiple books.

     * Implement the following classes: Model.Book, Model.User, Service.Library
     *
     * You don’t need to worry about a database or UI — just make sure your class design makes sense and includes appropriate fields and methods.
